# 🔨 Building

To build from source,
- Install Java JDK 21, the fabric API explains pretty well how to do so (note that you don't need the java JRE if you install the JDK, as it comes included with it)
> - [Windows](https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/installing-java/windows)
> - [MacOS](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:java:mac)
> - [Linux](https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/installing-java/linux)
- clone the repo and open it in Intellij IDEA (you can also use Eclipse or vsc)
- Let the IDE build and download all dependencies, you may have to reload the Gradle to download all dependencies

- Go in the Gradle sidebar and launch the `build` process
